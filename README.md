# zigsweeper

It's minesweeper, but in Zig and Raylib.

## Building and running

Ensure you have zig 0.12 installed (`zig build` tends to break between minor versions, so make sure to have that specific version installed).

`zig build run`

## TODO

- [ ] Set up winning and losing states
- [ ] Be able to reset the game
- [ ] Choose your difficulty
- [ ] Properly center mine numbers
- [ ] Improve testing
- [ ] Set up e2e testing?
